# Description
Astar path planning algorithm that finds path for a non-holonomic differential drive robot from a start position to an end position.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./Planner`.
5. The result will get saved in "path.csv"

# Side note
This is not a complete project yet. There are still some problems in the planner, it's not converging for several cases, which will be addressed in future.
