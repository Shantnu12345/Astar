# CPPND: Capstone Hello World Repo
For the capstone, I chose to implement an Astar path planning algorithm that finds path for a non-holonomic differential drive robot from a start position to an end position.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./Planner`.
5. The result will get saved in "path.csv"
